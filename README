Glass Scouter
=============

One-off joke app for Google Glass.

Adds a voice trigger that makes Glass respond to "what does the scouter say about his power level?" appropriately.

This is derived from the [stopwatch sample](https://github.com/googleglass/gdk-stopwatch-sample) and is my first Glass app (and first bit of Android dev in a long time... I think the last time I touched Android was before Google took it over). It's still quite rough and the code probably looks like it's still a stopwatch, but I'm cleaning it up.
